4. Click extension icon to open popup (fast or slow depends on the device you are using)
5. Read instructions, set your Gemini API Key (must have), model name and request interval (if you like default, skip them)

## Disclaimer
> All answers are just information that Gemini searched for and each model has different knowledge cut off, so accuracy cannot reach 100% in all cases, use with caution and double check if necessary.

I made this for myself and tried to cover all the bug cases I could think of, so if there are any bugs please submit an Issue =)))))
