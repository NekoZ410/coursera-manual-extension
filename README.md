## Disclaimer
> I am not responsible for any incorrect answers, repeated failed attempts that lead to exhaustion of retry attempts within a period of time, cases of fraud detection that lead to account suspension and legal issues that arise.
> 
> All answers are information that Gemini can search and each model has a different knowledge cut-off, so accuracy cannot be 100% in all cases. Use with caution and always double check.
